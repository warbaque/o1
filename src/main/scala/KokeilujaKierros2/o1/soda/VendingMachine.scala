/** The class `VendingMachine` can be used to simulate simple virtual soda vending 
  * machines. A vending machine sells bottles of a single type of soft drink at a 
  * certain price per bottle.
  *
  * The methods of the class correspond to the actions of buyers and maintenance 
  * personnel on an actual vending machine. For instance, a purchase is made by 
  * first inserting some money possibly several times with each one adding to the 
  * previous insertion, and then selecting to buy a bottle. This interaction is 
  * captured by the methods `insertMoney` and `buyBottle`.
  *
  * Some of the methods are illustrated in the following REPL session, in which 
  * the vending machine initially contains 10 bottles with a price of 250 cents 
  * (2.5 euros) each:
  *
  * {{{
  *  INPUT: val machine = new VendingMachine(250, 10)
  * OUTPUT: machine: o1.soda.VendingMachine = o1.soda.VendingMachine@1d0544e
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.description
  * OUTPUT: res0: String = earned 0.0 euros, inserted 0 cents, 10 bottles left
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.insertMoney(300)
  *
  *  INPUT: "got change: " + machine.sellBottle()
  * OUTPUT: res1: String = got change: 50
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.description
  * OUTPUT: res2: String = earned 2.5 euros, inserted 0 cents, 9 bottles left
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.insertMoney(50)
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.insertMoney(300)
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.sellBottle()
  * OUTPUT: res3: Int = 100
  *
  *  INPUT: machine.description
  * OUTPUT: res4: String = earned 5.0 euros, inserted 0 cents, 8 bottles left
  * }}}  
  *
  * As the example illustrates, a vending machine object has a mutable state: 
  * it keeps track of how much money the user has inserted, for instance. The 
  * machine also tracks the number of bottles it contains, the current (modifiable)
  * price per bottle, and the money it has "earned" by selling bottles.
  *
  * @param bottlePrice  the price of a single bottle
  * @param bottleCount  the initial number of bottles in the machine */
