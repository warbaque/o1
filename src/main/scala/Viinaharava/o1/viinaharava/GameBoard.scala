/** Each instance of the class `GameBoard` represents a board for a game of Viinaharava.
  * A game board is a `Grid` whose elements are `Glass` objects. 
  *
  * Some of these glasses --- in random locations --- will be initialized to contain booze; 
  * the rest keep their default content of water. The glasses are created and filled
  * as part of creating a `GameBoard`. 
  *
  * @param width       the number of glasses in each row of the game board
  * @param height      the number of rows of glasses in the game board
  * @param boozeCount  the number of booze glasses on the game board. When a `GameBoard` object 
  *                    is created, it randomly chooses this many different locations on the board
  *                    and pours booze in them.
