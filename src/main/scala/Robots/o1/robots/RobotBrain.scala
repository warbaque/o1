/** The class `RobotBrain` represents the "brains" (or artificial intelligence, AI) of virtual

  * for determining what a robot should do during its turn in a robot simulation. In other words, 
  * a robot brain is capable of controlling the actions of a robot body.
  *
  * Concrete classes that extend this class need to provide implementations for the abstract
  * `moveBody` method; each such concrete class can represent a new kind of robot behavior.
  *

  * @param body         the body the robot brain will control */
