/** The class `RobotBody` represents virtual robots (or "bots") which inhabit two-dimensional
  * grid worlds. More specifically, each instance of the class represents a "robot body"
  * (or "chassis" or "hardware") and basic functionality of such a robot. Each "robot body"
  * is associated with a "robot brain" that controls the body and determines what functionality
  * is activated and when.
  *
  * A robot is equipped with the various capabilities:
  *
  * - It can sense its own surroundings (location, facing, the world that it is in).
  *
  * - It can spin around in any one of the four main compass directions.
  *
  * - It can move into the next square in a given direction.
  *
  * - It can sense whether it is broken or not, and whether it is "stuck" in a square between
  *   four walls.
  *
  * When a robot's `takeTurn` method is called, it uses its "brain" to figure out what to do
  * (move, turn about, etc.). Robots with different kinds of brains behave differently.
  *
  * @param world            the world inhabited by the robot
  * @param initialLocation  the initial location of the robot in its world
  * @param initialFacing    the direction the robot initially faces in
  *
  * @see [[RobotWorld]]
  * @see [[RobotBrain]] */
